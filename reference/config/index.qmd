A Viash configuration is a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file which contains metadata to describe the behaviour and build target(s) of a component.  
We commonly name this file `config.vsh.yaml` in our examples, but you can name it however you choose.  

Here's an example of a config file:

```yaml
functionality:
  name: hello_world
  description: A minimal example component.
  arguments:
  - type: string
    name: --input
    default: "World"
  resources:
  - type: bash_script
    path: script.sh
platforms:
  - type: native
```

Every Viash config consists of two main sections: `functionality` and `platforms`.

## Functionality

The [`functionality`](/reference/config/functionality.html) section describes the behaviour of the component. This includes a name, a description and the arguments and resources the component needs to function.  
Check out our **Arguments** section on the left to find out more about the supported arguments. The [External Resources](/guide/component/resources.html) guide contains information on how to add resources and use them.

## Platforms

The `platforms` section specifies what platforms are supported as build targets for a component and their requirements. We support [native](/reference/config/platforms/NativePlatform.html), [Docker](/reference/config/platforms/DockerPlatform.html) and [Nextflow](/reference/config/platforms/NextflowVdsl3Platform.html). If no platforms are specified, the `native` platform is used by default.
