```{r setup, include=FALSE}
repo_path <- system("git rev-parse --show-toplevel", intern = TRUE)
source(paste0(repo_path, "/includes/_r_helper.R"))
# source(paste0(repo_path, "/guide_v2/component/_helper.R"))

temp_dir <- tempfile("variables")
dir.create(temp_dir, recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
on.exit(unlink(temp_dir, recursive = TRUE), add = TRUE)
```

## Todo: add


* Copy from guide/component/creation/nextflow.qmd. However, I'd trim down this page significantly and just mention "add - type: nextflow to get started". Add a notice that any of the functionality described in the "Viash component" chapter also applies to this.
* Building & running (copy from guide/building-block/nextflow/building-running.qmd)
