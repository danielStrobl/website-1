## Todo: add


* I feel this deserves a section on its own, because I see it's something a lot of new users are confused about.
* It would be create if you could show how to include an external file in the config yaml and how to access it from a script (i.e. meta["resources_dir"] + "/foo.txt".
* You can include the information shown on the FAQ faq/index.qmd section "Can I store helper functions as separate files?"
