```{r setup, include=FALSE}
repo_path <- system("git rev-parse --show-toplevel", intern = TRUE)
source(paste0(repo_path, "/includes/_r_helper.R"))
source(paste0(repo_path, "/guide_v2/component/_helper.R"))

temp_dir <- tempfile("variables")
dir.create(temp_dir, recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
on.exit(unlink(temp_dir, recursive = TRUE), add = TRUE)
```

## Todo: add


* I feel this deserves a section on its own, because I see it's something a lot of new users are confused about.
* It would be create if you could show how to include an external file in the config yaml and how to access it from a script (i.e. meta["resources_dir"] + "/foo.txt".
* You can include the information shown on the FAQ faq/index.qmd section "Can I store helper functions as separate files?"
