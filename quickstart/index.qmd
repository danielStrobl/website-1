This tutorial will guide you through using our Viash template project to run a data pipeline.

## Requirements

This guide assumes you've already installed [Viash](/installation), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#GetStarted).

## What is Viash?

**Viash** is a script code wrapper for building modular software components that serve as building blocks to develop (Nextflow) data pipelines. All you need is your script and a metadata file to get started.  
Here are a few of Viash's key features:

- You can use your [preferred scripting language](/guide/component/languages.html) per component, and mix and match scripts between multiple components as you please. Supported languages include: Bash, Python, R, Scala, JS and C#.
- A **custom Docker container** is automatically generated based on your dependencies described in your metadata. No expert Docker knowledge is required.
- Viash generates a **Nextflow module** from your script. No expert Nextflow knowledge is required. 
- You can simply script the nextflow modules to create and run your scalable and reproducible data pipeline.
- You can test every single module on your local workstation through the built-in development kit.

## Quickstart example project

This Quickstart will take you from nothing to a scalable and reproducible Nextflow data pipeline. Here's the flow of the pipeline you'll be using:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
   A(file?.tsv) --> B[/remove_comments/]
   B --> C[/take_column/]
   C --> D[/combine_columns/]
   D --> E(output)
```

One or more TSV files are taken as the input and will be processed through a series of modules. At the end, the output is written away to a folder.

## Step 1: Get the template

To get up and running fast, we provide a [template project](https://github.com/viash-io/viash_project_template) for you to use. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Git clone

Run the command below to clone the template repository to a new folder named **advanced_pipeline**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/viash-io/viash_project_template advanced_pipeline
```

## Zip download

Click the button below to download a zip file containing the template project. Once downloaded, unzip the file and rename the root directory to **advanced_pipeline**.

The template repo contains the following files:

    .
    ├── LICENSE.md                            License information
    ├── README.qmd                            The source qmd file for this readme
    ├── README.md                             This readme
    ├── _viash.yaml                           Global Viash settings
    ├── resources_test/*.tsv                  Sample files to showcase pipeline and
    │   ├── file1.tsv                         run component unit tests.
    │   └── file2.tsv
    ├── src/demo                              Source directory with Viash components
    │   ├── combine_columns
    │   ├── remove_comments
    │   └── take_column
    └── workflows
        └── demo_pipeline                     Demo Nextflow pipeline
            ├── main.nf
            └── nextflow.config


## Step 2: Build the Viash components

With Viash you can turn the components in `src/` into Dockerized Nextflow modules by running:

```bash
viash ns build --setup cachedbuild --parallel
```

While building, this will result in the following output:

```
Exporting take_column (demo) =docker=> target/docker/demo/take_column
[notice] Building container 'ghcr.io/viash-io/viash_project_template/demo_take_column:dev' with Dockerfile
Exporting take_column (demo) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/demo/take_column
Exporting remove_comments (demo) =docker=> target/docker/demo/remove_comments
[notice] Building container 'ghcr.io/viash-io/viash_project_template/demo_remove_comments:dev' with Dockerfile
Exporting remove_comments (demo) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/demo/remove_comments
Exporting combine_columns (demo) =docker=> target/docker/demo/combine_columns
[notice] Building container 'ghcr.io/viash-io/viash_project_template/demo_combine_columns:dev' with Dockerfile
Exporting combine_columns (demo) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/demo/combine_columns
All 6 configs built successfully
```

Once everything is built, a new **target** directory has been created containing the executables and modules grouped per platform:

```
target/
├── docker
│   └── demo
│       ├── combine_columns
│       │   ├── combine_columns
│       │   └── viash.yaml
│       ├── remove_comments
│       │   ├── remove_comments
│       │   └── viash.yaml
│       └── take_column
│           ├── take_column
│           └── viash.yaml
└── nextflow
    └── demo
        ├── combine_columns
        │   ├── main.nf
        │   ├── nextflow.config
        │   └── viash.yaml
        ├── remove_comments
        │   ├── main.nf
        │   ├── nextflow.config
        │   └── viash.yaml
        └── take_column
            ├── main.nf
            ├── nextflow.config
            └── viash.yaml
```

## Step 3: Run the pipeline

Now run run the pipeline with Nextflow:

```bash
nextflow run . \
  -main-script workflows/demo_pipeline/main.nf \
  -with-docker \
  --input resources_test/file*.tsv \
  --publishDir temp
```

This will run the three modules in sequence, with the final result result being stored in a file named **combined.combine_columns.output.tsv** in a new **temp** directory:

```
"1"     0.11
"2"     0.23
"3"     0.35
"4"     0.47
```
