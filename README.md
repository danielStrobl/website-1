## Instructions

The main files live in the **documentation** folder.
To create a new version of the website, execute this from the root of the project:

```
quarto render
```

This will generate html files in the **docs** directory. 
After pushing the changes to main, the website will be rebuilt and published via gh pages. After a few minutes the changes should be visible.
