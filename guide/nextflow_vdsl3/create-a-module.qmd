## Todo: add


* Copy from guide/component/creation/nextflow.qmd. However, I'd trim down this page significantly and just mention "add - type: nextflow to get started". Add a notice that any of the functionality described in the "Viash component" chapter also applies to this.
* Building & running (copy from guide/building-block/nextflow/building-running.qmd)
