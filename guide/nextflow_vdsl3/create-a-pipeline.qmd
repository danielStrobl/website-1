title: Create a pipeline *
order: 30
---



## Todo: add

* Assume knowledge of Nextflow (see Nextflow guide). Data Intuitive also offers specialized Nextflow + Viash courses.

* Copy guide/data-workflow/nextflow-pipeline/pipeline-advanced.qmd
* Use template repository instead of download buttons

* New content:
  - How to use a module in a pipeline.
  - Specify that we assume the user knows how to write a Nextflow pipeline
  - Dynamic behaviour (.run()): dynamic directives and auto helper.
  - Nextflow Viash config
  - Showcase pre-existing pipeline, e.g. guide/data-workflow/nextflow-pipeline/pipeline-advanced.qmd
  - Todo: update to latest VDSL3 practices. Let the targetDir use the rootDir. Use the newer WorkflowHelper helper functions.
