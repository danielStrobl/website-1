## Todo: add


* Copy guide/component/unit-testing.qmd.
* Add a note that the scripting language of the unit test doesn't need to match the language of the main script, as long as all of the requirements are available.
* It would be nice to add examples on how to write unit tests in different languages (similar to how it's done on other pages).
