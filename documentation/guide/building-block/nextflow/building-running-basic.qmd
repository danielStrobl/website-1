## Overview

This guide covers how you can can build a Nextflow module and run it as a standalone pipeline.

## Building a Nextflow VDSL3 module

To start off, either follow along with the [basic Nextflow component creation guide](/documentation/guide/component/creation/nextflow-basic.html) to create a simple `hello_world` component that targets Nextflow or download the zip below containing the component in all [supported languages](/documentation/guide/component/languages.html).  

```{python}
create_zip(parent_dir = "/download/components/", zip_dir = "hello_world_nextflow")
create_download_button("/download/components/hello_world_nextflow.zip")
```

If you downloaded the zip above, rename the language folder you want to use to `hello_world` and use that as your working directory.  
  
To let Viash generate a Nextflow module from your component, use the [viash build](/documentation/reference/viash/build.html) command:

```bash
viash build src/config.vsh.yaml --platform nextflow --output target
```

This will generate two files in the target directory: a pipeline script named **main.nf** and a Nextflow config file named **nextflow.config**. Your directory structure should now look like this:

```
hello_world
├── src
│   ├── config.vsh.yaml
│   └── script.sh
└── target
    ├── main.nf
    └── nextflow.config
```

## Running a standalone pipeline

With the module built, you can now call the pipeline script from nextflow to run it standalone.
Now run the module along with the required arguments:

```bash
nextflow run target/main.nf
```

Below is the result:

```

```

## What's next?

To use generated modules inside an actual Nextflow pipeline, take a look at our [Pipeline Basics](/documentation/guide/data-workflow/nextflow-pipeline/pipeline-basics.html) guide.
