## Overview

You can build a Nextflow module to use in your pipeline
To start with, [create a Viash component that targets the Nextflow platform](/documentation//guide/component/creation/nextflow.html).

## Building a Nextflow VDSL3 module



```bash
viash build remove_comments/config.vsh.yaml -o target/remove_comments
```   

This will generate two files in the **target/remove_comments** directory: **main.nf** and **nextflow.config**.

## Run module as a standalone pipeline

A VDSL3 module can be run as a small, standalone Nextflow pipeline.  

### Show documentation

To display the documentation for a module, run the module with just the `--help` argument:

```bash
nextflow run target/remove_comments/main.nf --help
```

This will result in output that looks similar to this:

```
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 22.04.3
Launching `target/remove_comments/main.nf` [admiring_carlsson] DSL2 - revision: 8de4c7c8eb
remove_comments

Options:
    --input
        type: file, required parameter
        example: file.tsv

    --output
        type: file, required parameter, output
        example: file.tsv
```

As you can see, this module needs a **tsv file** as its `input` and it will write the updated file away to a given `output` path.

### Run module

To test out the module by itself, you need a tsv file to remove the comments from. You download a sample file we provided here: 

ewqeq

Place it in a new directory named **data**, alongside the **src** and **target** directories.


```bash
nextflow run target/remove_comments/main.nf \
   --input "data/file1.tsv" \
   --publishDir output/
```
