## Overview
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It's used primarily among data miners, bioinformaticians and staticians for data analysis and developing statistical software.

## Dependencies

To be able to run R scripts, you'll need [download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) for your OS. 

## Referencing R scripts in a Viash config file

When referencing a R script in the [`resources`](/documentation/reference/config/functionality.html#resources) of the `functionality` section your [Viash config](/documentation/reference/config/overview.html), use `r_script` as its type:

```yaml
functionality:
  name: my_component
  resources:
  - type: r_script
    path: script.r
```

## Executing scripts

R scripts end with the **.r** extension. They can be run locally by using the `Rscript` command:

```bash
Rscript script.r
```

## Script examples

These examples will briefly show to use R in the context of Viash. Each example shows the source code and the output after running it.

### Using variables

**Variables.r**
```R
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

hello = "Hello World!"
cat(hello)
```

**Output**
```
Hello World!
```

### Using Viash arguments as variables

Viash generates variables based on the arguments defined in the [Viash config file](/documentation/reference/config/overview.html) and injects them at the top of your script.  In the case of R, these variables are grouped inside a list named `par` and can be referenced by name.

**config.vsh.yaml**
```yaml
functionality:
  name: hello_world
  arguments:
  - type: string
    name: --hello
    default: "Hello World!"
  resources:
  - type: r_script
    path: ViashVariables.r
```

**ViashVariables.r**
```R
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

cat(par$hello)
```

**Output**
```
Hello World!
```

### Using Viash placeholder variables

In some cases, you want to be able to write or adapt a script and test it out before creating a component. While you can write your script as normal and switch out the variables later on with their Viash variants, we supply a useful method of adding Viash variables beforehand in the form of a comment section.

**PlaceholderVariables.r**
```R
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

## VIASH START
par <- list(
  hello = "Hello World!"
)
## VIASH END

cat(par$hello)
```

**Output**
```
Hello World!
```

Anything between `## VIASH START` and `## VIASH END` will be replaced by the injected variables Viash generates once the script is executed as part of a component. This allows you to easily troubleshoot your script while being compatible with Viash.  

## Meta variables

Viash offers hidden variables to use in your scripts that can be used to get meta information about your component.

### Functionality name

Name of the component found in the [`functionality`](/documentation/reference/config/functionality.html) section of the [Viash config](/documentation/reference/config/overview.html):

```yaml
functionality:
  name: my_component
```

This can be referenced in your script using `meta$functionality_name`:

```R
cat(meta$functionality_name)
```

**Output**
```
my_component
```

### Resources directory

Path where the [resources](/documentation/reference/config/functionality.html#resources) as defined in the [Viash config file](/documentation/reference/config/overview.html) are stored. You can access this value using `meta$resources_dir`:

```R
cat(meta$resources_dir)
```

When using [`viash run`](/documentation/reference/viash/run.html) to create a temporary build target and execute it, this will point to the temporary path where the executable was generated:

```
/tmp/viash_my_component9560481446119256265
```

After building a component using [`viash build`](/documentation/reference/viash/build.html) and running the generated executable, it points to the directory where the executable and the other resources reside in:

```
/home/user/components/my_component_target_dir
```

### Temp directory

Path to the directory supplied by the host system where you can write temporary files to. This can be referenced in your script using `meta$temp_dir`:

```R
cat(meta$temp_dir)
```

**Output**
```
/tmp
```
