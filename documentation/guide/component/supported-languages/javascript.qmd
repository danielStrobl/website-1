## Overview

Viash supports JavaScript as a scripting language via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), a runtime build on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/).

## Dependencies

To run JavaScript on your system, you'll need to download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) from their homepage.

## Referencing JavaScript scripts in a Viash config file

When referencing a JavaScript script in the [`resources`](/documentation/reference/config/functionality.html#resources) of the `functionality` section your [Viash config](/documentation/reference/config/overview.html), use `javascript_script` as its type:

```yaml
functionality:
  name: my_component
  resources:
  - type: javascript_script
    path: script.js
```

## Executing scripts

JavaScript scripts end with the **.js** extension. They can be run locally by using the `node` command:

```bash
node script.js
```

## Script examples

These examples will briefly show to use JavaScript in the context of Viash. Each example shows the source code and the output after running it.

### Hello World

Here's the classic Hello World written in JavaScript:

**HelloWorld.js**
```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log('Hello World!')
```

**Output**
```
Hello World!
```

:::{.callout-note}
The first line with the [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) is optional but recommended as it indicates what interpreter should be used for execution.

### Using variables

**Variables.js**
```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

let hello = 'Hello World!'
console.log(hello)
```

**Output**
```
Hello World!
```

### Using Viash arguments as variables

Viash generates variables based on the arguments defined in the [Viash config file](/documentation/reference/config/overview.html) and injects them at the top of your script.  In the case of JavaScript, these variables are grouped inside a dictionary named `par` and can be referenced by name.

**config.vsh.yaml**
```yaml
functionality:
  name: hello_world
  arguments:
  - type: string
    name: --hello
    default: "Hello World!"
  resources:
  - type: javascript_script
    path: script.js
```

**ViashVariables.js**
```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log(par['hello'])
```

**Output**
```
Hello World!
```

### Using Viash placeholder variables

In some cases, you want to be able to write or adapt a script and test it out before creating a component. While you can write your script as normal and switch out the variables later on with their Viash variants, we supply a useful method of adding Viash variables beforehand in the form of a comment section.

**PlaceholderVariables.js**
```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

// VIASH START
let par = {
    'hello': 'Hello World!'
  }
// VIASH END

console.log(par['hello'])
```

**Output**
```
Hello World!
```

Anything between `// VIASH START` and `// VIASH END` will be replaced by the injected variables Viash generates once the script is executed as part of a component. This allows you to easily troubleshoot your script while being compatible with Viash.  

## Meta variables

Viash offers hidden variables to use in your scripts that can be used to get meta information about your component.

### Functionality name

Name of the component found in the [`functionality`](/documentation/reference/config/functionality.html) section of the [Viash config](/documentation/reference/config/overview.html):

```yaml
functionality:
  name: my_component
```

This can be referenced in your script using `meta['functionality_name']`:

```js
console.log(meta['functionality_name']);
```

**Output**
```
my_component
```

### Resources directory

Path where the [resources](/documentation/reference/config/functionality.html#resources) as defined in the [Viash config file](/documentation/reference/config/overview.html) are stored. You can access this value using `meta['resources_dir']`:

```js
console.log(meta['resources_dir']);
```

When using [`viash run`](/documentation/reference/viash/run.html) to create a temporary build target and execute it, this will point to the temporary path where the executable was generated:

```
/tmp/viash_my_component9560481446119256265
```

After building a component using [`viash build`](/documentation/reference/viash/build.html) and running the generated executable, it points to the directory where the executable and the other resources reside in:

```
/home/user/components/my_component_target_dir
```

### Temp directory

Path to the directory supplied by the host system where you can write temporary files to. This can be referenced in your script using `meta['temp_dir']`:

```js
console.log(meta['temp_dir']);
```

**Output**
```
/tmp
```
