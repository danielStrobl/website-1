## Overview

A Viash component can target one or more platforms. When targetting the native platform, a single executable is generated.
This guide will build upon

## Requirements

The example targets the [Native platform](#), which means you will need to have the required packages installed on your system depending on your chosen scripting language. If you are using any of the languages on your system, there's a good chance you already meet the requirements. To get up and running quickly, we recommend using Bash.

### Writing the script

For this example, you'll use a tiny script that simply outputs "Hello Viash", with the "Viash" part being a variable. 
To start off, create a folder named **hello_viash** and follow the instructions below based on your preferred scripting language.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Bash

Create a new file named **script.sh** and copy the following content inside of it:

```{python}
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/bash/script.sh", "yaml", False)
```

This outputs `Hello ` to the console, followed by an `input` variable. Notice that this variable isn't defined in the script itself as Viash will generate it for you based on the config file you'll create in the next step.

:::{.callout-tip}
Every scripting language has its own way of using variables generated by Viash. Check out the [Bash page](#) for more information and examples.
:::


## C\#

Create script.csx

```{python}
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/csharp/script.csx", "yaml", False)
```

This outputs `Hello ` to the console, followed by an `input` variable. Notice that this variable isn't defined in the script itself as Viash will generate it for you based on the config file you'll create in the next step.

:::{.callout-tip}
Every scripting language has its own way of using variables generated by Viash. Check out the [C# page](#) for more information and examples.
:::

## Javascript

Create script.js

```{python}
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/js/script.js", "yaml", False)
```

This outputs `Hello ` to the console, followed by an `input` variable. Notice that this variable isn't defined in the script itself as Viash will generate it for you based on the config file you'll create in the next step.

:::{.callout-tip}
Every scripting language has its own way of using variables generated by Viash. Check out the [Javascript page](#) for more information and examples.
:::

## Python

Create script.py

```{python}
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/python/script.py", "yaml", False)
```

This outputs `Hello ` to the console, followed by an `input` variable. Notice that this variable isn't defined in the script itself as Viash will generate it for you based on the config file you'll create in the next step.

:::{.callout-tip}
Every scripting language has its own way of using variables generated by Viash. Check out the [Python page](#) for more information and examples.
:::

## Scala

Create script.scala

```{python}
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/scala/script.scala", "yaml", False)
```

This outputs `Hello ` to the console, followed by an `input` variable. Notice that this variable isn't defined in the script itself as Viash will generate it for you based on the config file you'll create in the next step.

:::{.callout-tip}
Every scripting language has its own way of using variables generated by Viash. Check out the [Scala page](#) for more information and examples.
:::

## R

Create script.R

```{python}
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/r/script.R", "yaml", False)
```

This outputs `Hello ` to the console, followed by an `input` variable. Notice that this variable isn't defined in the script itself as Viash will generate it for you based on the config file you'll create in the next step.

:::{.callout-tip}
Every scripting language has its own way of using variables generated by Viash. Check out the [R page](#) for more information and examples.

### Adding the config
 
A [Viash config file]() is a YAML file that describes the functionality of a component and the platform(s) it targets.
Create a file name **config.vsh.yaml** and add the contents below based on your chosen scripting language.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Bash

```{python}
create_download_button("/download/hello_viash/bash/config.vsh.yaml")
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/bash/config.vsh.yaml", "yaml", False)
```

## C\#

```{python}
create_download_button("/download/hello_viash/csharp/config.vsh.yaml")
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/csharp/config.vsh.yaml", "yaml", False)
```

## Javascript

```{python}
create_download_button("/download/hello_viash/js/config.vsh.yaml")
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/js/config.vsh.yaml", "yaml", False)
```

## Python

```{python}
create_download_button("/download/hello_viash/python/config.vsh.yaml")
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/python/config.vsh.yaml", "yaml", False)
```

## Scala

```{python}
create_download_button("/download/hello_viash/scala/config.vsh.yaml")
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/scala/config.vsh.yaml", "yaml", False)
```

## R

```{python}
create_download_button("/download/hello_viash/r/config.vsh.yaml")
print_file_contents("/download/hello_viash/r/config.vsh.yaml", "yaml", False)
```

:::

### Running

With the two necessary files present to create a component, you can call upon Viash to generate a temporary executable and run it:

```bash
viash run config.vsh.yaml
```

Without passing any arguments, this will use the default value for `--input`, which is `Viash`. This results in the following output:

```
Hello Viash
```

By providing the a value for `--input`, you can customize the greeting: 

```bash
viash run config.vsh.yaml -- --input World
```

:::{.callout-note}
The double dash (`--`) between the viash command and the arguments is used to signify the end of the arguments passed to viash and the start of those passed to the component. If you forgot to add these, you'll get an error similar to this:   
  
```bash
[scallop] Error: Unknown option 'input'
```
:::

The example above results in this output:

```
Hello World
```
