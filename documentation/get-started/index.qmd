## Linux

### Requirements

Viash is developed in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), so you'll need to install [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8-linux), [OpenJDK 8](https://openjdk.org/install/) or a later version.  
You can run the following command to check if you have Java installed:

```bash
java -version
```

:::{.callout-note}
Java version "1.8.x" and "8" are the same release.
:::

To get the most out of Viash, you'll also need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/).

### Installing Viash

To install Viash to a `bin` folder in your current directory, run the following command to download and run the install script:

```bash
wget -qO- get.viash.io | bash
```

To verify your installation, run the following command:

```bash
bin/viash --help
```

## macOS

curl -fsSL get.viash.io | bash
```

To verify your installation, run the following command:

```bash
bin/viash --help
```

## Windows


### Requirements

Viash is developed in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), so you'll need to install [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8-windows), [OpenJDK 8](https://openjdk.org/install/) or a later version.  
You can run the following command to check if you have Java installed:

```bash

<!-- To get the most out of Viash, you'll also need to install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). -->

### Setting up WSL2

Viash doesn't support Windows natively, but [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) can be used instead. Follow the instructions below to get everything ready to use Viash:

1. Install WSL2 by following the [instructions provided by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). This will install the default distro, **Ubuntu**.
2. Follow [these instructions provided by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) to install **Docker Desktop** with a WSL2 backend. This allows you to run Linux docker containers natively.
3. Open **Ubuntu** from the **Start** menu to start up WSL2.
4. Run the following command in the Ubuntu terminal to upgrade Ubuntu and its packages to the newest version:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

5. Run this command to check if docker is working correctly:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If this doesn't work, read the [Docker WSL instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) again, you might have missed a step or forgot to reboot your system. 

6. Install the Viash dependencies by executing this command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-12-jdk unzip zip
```

:::{.callout-note}
You can choose to install `default-jdk` instead of the more explicit `openjdk-12-jdk`. However, the [Nextflow target platform](/api/config/platform-nextflow/) only supports Java version 8 to 12 at this point in time, so keep that in mind.
:::

7. (optional but recommended) Install [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/).

### Installing Viash

To install Viash to a `bin` folder in your current directory, run the following command to download and run the install script:

```bash
wget -qO- get.viash.io | bash
```

To verify your installation, run the following command:

```bash
bin/viash --help
```
