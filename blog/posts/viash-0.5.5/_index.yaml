  \ added to the PATH variable. \n  To alter this behaviour, set `.functionality.add_resources_to_path`\
  \ to `true`.\n\n### MINOR CHANGES\n\n* Bash Script: only define variables which\
  \ have values.\n\n* CSharp Test Component: Change Docker image to `dataintuitive/dotnet-script`\
  \ to have more control over the lifecycle of \n  versioned tags.\n\n* Updated Code\
  \ of Conduct from v2.0 to v2.1.\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\n* Viash namespace: Fix incorrect\
  \ output path when the parent directory of a Viash component is not equal to the\

subtitle: Resources dir no longer added to PATH automatically and minor changes
version: 0.5.5
whats_new: "\nThe resources directory is no longer added to the PATH variable by default.\
  \ You can re-enable this behaviour by setting add_resources_to_path to `true` in\
  \ the functionality part of the config file.  \nHere's a snippet of a config file\
  \ to illustrate this:\n\n  ```yaml\n  functionality:\n    name: example_component\n\
  \    description: Serve as a simple example.\n    add_resources_to_path: true\n\
  \    ...\n  ```\n\n"
