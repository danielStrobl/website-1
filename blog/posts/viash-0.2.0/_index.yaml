changes: "### NEW FEATURES\n\n* Allow (optional) version attributes in `functionality.yaml`\
  \ and `platform.yaml`.\n* Allow testing a component with the `viash test` functionality.\
  \ Tests are executed in a temporary directory on the specified platform. The temporary\
  \ directory contains all the resource and test files. \n* `viash --version`: Add\
  \ flag for printing the version of viash.\n* Allow fetching resources from URL (http://\
  \ and https://)\n* Allow retrieving functionality and platform YAMLs from URL.\n\
  * For docker containers, autoresolve path names of files. Use `---v path:path` or\
  \ `---volume path:path` to manually mount a specific folder.\n* Implement parameter\
  \ multiplicity. \n  Set `multiple: true` to denote an argument to have higher multiplicity.\
  \ \n  Run `./cmd --foo one --foo two --foo three:four` in order for multiple values\
  \ to be added to the same parameter list.\n* Added a new format for defining functionality\
  \ in which the user passes the script in which the functionality and platforms are\
  \ listed as yaml headers.\n* A `---chown` flag has been added to Docker executables\
  \ to automatically change the ownership of output files to the current user.\n*\
  \ `viash ns build`: A command for building a whole namespace.\n* `NXF`: Join operations\
  \ are now fully supported by means of `multiple`.\n* `NXF`: Modules that perform\
  \ joins can take either arrays (multiple input files or the same type to be joined)\
  \ or hashes (multiple input files passed using different options on the CLI). Please\
  \ refer to the docs for more info.\n\n### MAJOR CHANGES\n\n* Remove passthrough\
  \ parameters.\n* Since CLI generation is now performed in the outer script, `viash\
  \ pimp` has been deprecated.\n* Write out meta.yaml containing viash run information\
  \ as well as the original `functionality.yaml` and `platform.yaml` content.\n* Renamed\
  \ `viash export` to `viash build`.\n\n### MINOR CHANGES\n\n* `viash run` and `viash\
  \ test`: Allow changing the temporary directory by defining `VIASH_TEMP` as a environment\
  \ variable. Temporary directories are cleaned up after successful executions.\n\
  * `viash run` and `viash test`: Exit(1) when execution or test fails.\n* `viash\
  \ build`: Add -m flag for outputting metadata after build.\n* `viash run`: Required\
  \ parameters can have a default value now. Produce error when a required parameter\
  \ is not passed, even when a default is provided.\n* `NXF`: _Modules_ are now stored\
  \ under `target/nextflow` by default\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\n* `NXF`: Correctly escape\
  \ path variable when running NXF command.\n* `NXF`: Surround parameters with quotes\
  \ when running NXF command.\n\n### INTERNAL CHANGES\n\n* Move CLI from inner script\
  \ to outer script.\n* Renamed Target to Platform\n* Renamed Environment to Requirements\n\

subtitle: Autoresolve docker paths
version: 0.2.0
whats_new: "\n### Changes to functionality metadata\n\n- Added version attribute\n\
  \n#### Autoresolve docker paths\n\nArguments of type: file are processed to automatically\
  \ create a mount in docker. More specifically, when you pass an argument value:\
  \ `--input /path/to/file`, this will be processed such that the following parameters\
  \ are passed to docker:\n\n  ```bash\n  docker run -v /path/to:/viash_automount/path/to\
  \ ... --input /viash_automount/path/to/file\n  ```\n\nIf, for some reason, you need\
  \ to manually specify a mount, you can do this with `---mount /path/to/mount:/mymount`.\n\
  \n#### Argument multiplicity\n\nFor all parameter types (except for `boolean_true`\
  \ and `boolean_false`), you can specify `multiple: true` in order to turn this argument\
  \ into an array-based argument. What this does is allow you to pass multiple values\
  \ for this argument, e.g. `--input file1 --input file2 --input file3:file4:file5`.\n\
  \nThe default separator is `:` but this can be overridden by changing the separator\
  \ by setting it to `multiple_sep: \",\"` (for example).\n\n#### New format\n\nViash\
  \ now supports placing the functionality.yaml, platform*.yaml(s) and script into\
  \ a single file. For example, this could be a merged script.R:\n\n  ```r\n  #' functionality:\n\
  \  #'   name: r-estimate\n  #'   arguments: ...\n  #' platforms:\n  #' - type: native\n\
  \  #' - type: docker\n  #'   image: rocker/tidyverse\n  library(tidyverse)\n  cat(\"\
  Hello world!\\n\")\n  ```\n\nInstead of running:\n\n  ```bash\n  viash run -f functionality.yaml\
  \ -p platform_docker.yaml -- arg1\n  ```\n\nWith this format, you can now run:\n\
  \n  ```bash\n  viash run script.R                     # run script.R with the first\
  \ platform\n  viash run -P docker script.R           # run script.R with the platform\
  \ called 'docker' with the large P argument\n  # use small p to override the platform\
  \ with a custom yaml:\n  viash run -p common_resources/platform_docker.yaml script.R\n\
  \  # note that any arguments for the run command (e.g. -p or -P) should come before\
  \ the script.R, as script.R is considered a trailing argument.\n  ```\n\n"
