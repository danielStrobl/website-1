changes: "### NEW FUNCTIONALITY\n\n* Resolve resource and merge paths starting with\
  \ a slash (`/`) as relative to the project directory (PR #380). To define absolute\
  \ paths (which is not recommended anyway), prefix the path with the `file://` protocol.\
  \ Examples:\n\n  - `/foo` is a file or directory called `foo` in the current project\
  \ directory.\n  - `file:/foo` is a file or directory called `foo` in the system\
  \ root.\n\n### MINOR CHANGES\n\n* `viash config view`: Do not modify (e.g. strip\
  \ empty fields) of the `.functionality.info` and `.functionality.arguments[].info`\
  \ fields (#386).\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\n* `ConfigMods`: Fix operator precedence issues\
  \ with conditions in the config mod parsers (PR #390).\n\n### INTERNAL CHANGES\n\
  \n* Clean up unused code (PR #380).\n\n* Move circe encoders/decoders for File and\
  \ Path from `io.viash.functionality.arguments` to `io.viash.helpers.circe` (PR #380).\n\
  \n* Store the project root directory (that is, the directory of the `_viash.yaml`)\
  \ in a ViashProject object (PR #380).\n\n* Tests: Reworked language tests to be\
  \ grouped in their own subfolder and split off the bash language test from the general\
  \ `testbash` folder (PR #381).\n\n* Tests: Add additional language tests for `viash\
  \ config inject` (PR #381).\n\n* Tests: Added test for `io.viash.helpers.IO` (PR\
  \ #380).\n\n\n"
