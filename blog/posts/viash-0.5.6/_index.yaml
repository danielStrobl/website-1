changes: "### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n* `BashWrapper`: Forbidden flags `-v`, `--verbose`,\
  \ `--verbosity` have been renamed to `---v`, `---verbose`, `---verbosity`.\n\n###\
  \ MINOR CHANGES\n\n* Set version of helper scripts to the same version as Viash.\n\
  \n* `DockerPlatform`: Produce helpful warning message when Docker image can't be\
  \ found remotely (#94).\n\n* `DockerPlatform`: Produce helpful error message when\
  \ Docker isn't installed or the daemon is not running (#94 bis).\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\
  \n* `viash_install`:\n  - Passing Viash path as a string instead of as a file to\
  \ ensure the path is not converted to an absolute path\n  - Switch from Docker backend\
  \ to a Native backend, 'unzip' and 'wget' are required.\n  - Correctly set the log\
  \ file for viash_test.\n  \n* `DockerPlatform`: Added sleep workaround to avoid\
  \ concurrency issue where a file is executed to\n  build docker containers but apparently\
  \ still in the process of being written.\n  \n* `DockerPlatform`: Fix order issue\
  \ of ---verbose flag in combination with ---setup, allowing to run \n  `viash run\
  \ config.vsh.yaml -- ---setup cb ---verbose` and actually get output.\n  \n\n"
