changes: "### MINOR CHANGES\n\n* `DockerPlatform`: Added `run_args` field to allow\
  \ setting `docker run` arguments.\n\n* `NextflowPlatform`: Added argument `separate_multiple_outputs`\
  \ to allow not separating the outputs generated by a \n  component with multiple\
  \ outputs as separate events on the channel.\n\n### BUG FIX\n\n* `IO`: Allow overwriting\
  \ directory resources upon rebuild.\n\n"

subtitle: More settings for Docker and Nextflow platform, and a bug fixes for components
  with resources
version: 0.5.2
whats_new: "\nThis is a small release containing two small features and a bug fix.\n\
  The new `run_args` field allows you to add [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)\
  \ arguments to the [Docker platform](/reference/config/platforms/docker/#) section\
  \ of a [config file](/reference/config/index.html). For example:\n\n  ```yaml\n\
  \  platforms:\n    - type: docker\n      image: bash:4.0\n      run_args: \"--expose\
  \ 127.0.0.1:80:8080/tcp --env MY_ENV_VAR=foo\"\n  ```\n\nThere's also a new field\
  \ for the [Nextflow platform](/reference/config/platforms/nextflow/#): `separate_multiple_outputs`.\
  \ By default, this is set to `true` and separates the outputs generated by a Nextflow\
  \ component with multiple outputs as separate events on the channel. You can now\
  \ choose to disable this behaviour:\n\n  ```yaml\n  platforms:\n    - type: nextflow\n\
  \      publish: true\n      separate_multiple_outputs: false\n  ```\n\n"
