changes: "### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n* `NextflowPlatform`: `variant: vdsl3` is now the\
  \ default NextflowPlatform. `variant: legacy` has been deprecated.\n\n* `Functionality`:\
  \ Fields `.inputs` and `.outputs` has been deprecated. Please use `.argument_groups`\
  \ instead (#186).\n  Before:\n  ```yaml\n  functionality:\n    inputs:\n      -\
  \ name: \"--foo\"\n    outputs:\n      - name: \"--bar\"\n  ```\n  Now:\n  ```yaml\n\
  \  functionality:\n    argument_groups:\n      - name: Inputs\n        arguments:\n\
  \          - name: \"--foo\"\n            type: file\n      - name: Outputs\n  \
  \      arguments:\n          - name: \"--bar\"\n            type: file\n       \
  \     direction: output\n  ```\n\n* Passing strings to an argument group's arguments\
  \ has been deprecated. Please simply copy the argument itself into the argument\
  \ group (#186).\n  Before:\n  ```yaml\n  functionality:\n    arguments:\n      -\
  \ name: \"--foo\"\n        type: file\n      - name: \"--bar\"\n        type: file\n\
  \        direction: output\n    argument_groups:\n      - name: Inputs\n       \
  \ arguments: [ foo ]\n      - name: Outputs\n        arguments: [ bar ]\n  ```\n\
  \  Now:\n  ```yaml\n  functionality:\n    argument_groups:\n      - name: Inputs\n\
  \        arguments:\n          - name: \"--foo\"\n            type: file\n     \
  \ - name: Outputs\n        arguments:\n          - name: \"--bar\"\n           \
  \ type: file\n            direction: output\n  ```\n\n### NEW FUNCTIONALITY\n\n\
  * Allow setting the number of processes and memory limit from within the Viash config,\
  \ \n  as well as a list of required commands. Example:\n\n  ```yaml\n  functionality:\n\
  \  name: foo\n  requirements:\n    cpus: 10\n    memory: 10GB\n    commands: [ bash,\
  \ r, perl ]\n  ```\n  \n  You can override the default requirements at runtime:\n\
  \n  - `./foo ---cpus 4 ---memory 100PB` (for NativePlatform or DockerPlatform)\n\
  \  - By adding `process.cpus = 4` and `process.memory \"100 PB\"` to a nextflow.config\
  \ (for NextflowPlatform)\n\n  This results the following meta variables to be injected\
  \ into a script:\n\n  - `meta_cpus` (in Bash) or `meta[\"cpus\"]` (in any other\
  \ language): Number of processes the script is allowed to spawn.\n  - `meta_memory_b`\
  \ (in Bash) or `meta[\"memory_b\"]` (in any other language): Amount of memory the\
  \ script is allowed to allocate, in bytes.\n  - `meta_memory_kb` (in Bash) or `meta[\"\
  memory_kb\"]` (in any other language): Same but in kilobytes, rounded up.\n  - `meta_memory_mb`\
  \ (in Bash) or `meta[\"memory_mb\"]` (in any other language): Same but in megabytes,\
  \ rounded up.\n  - `meta_memory_gb` (in Bash) or `meta[\"memory_gb\"]` (in any other\
  \ language): Same but in gigabytes, rounded up.\n  - `meta_memory_tb` (in Bash)\
  \ or `meta[\"memory_tb\"]` (in any other language): Same but in terabytes, rounded\
  \ up.\n  - `meta_memory_pb` (in Bash) or `meta[\"memory_pb\"]` (in any other language):\
  \ Same but in petabytes, rounded up.\n  \n* `viash ns exec`: Added a command for\
  \ executing arbitrary commands for all found Viash components.\n  The syntax of\
  \ this command is inspired by `find . -exec echo {} \\;`.\n  \n  The following fields\
  \ are automatically replaced:\n   * `{}` | `{path}`: path to the config file\n \
  \  * `{abs-path}`: absolute path to the config file\n   * `{dir}`: path to the parent\
  \ directory of the config file\n   * `{abs-dir}`: absolute path to the directory\
  \ of the config file\n   * `{main-script}`: path to the main script (if any)\n \
  \  * `{abs-main-script}`: absolute path to the main script (if any)\n   * `{functionality-name}`:\
  \ name of the component\n  \n  A command suffixed by `\\;` (or nothing) will execute\
  \ one command for each\n  of the Viash components, whereas a command suffixed by\
  \ `+` will execute one\n  command for all Viash components.\n\n* `ConfigMod`: Added\
  \ a `del(...)` config mod to be able to delete a value from the yaml. Example: `del(.functionality.version)`.\n\
  \n### MAJOR CHANGES\n\n* `Folder structure`: Adjusted the folder structure to correctly\
  \ reflect the the namespace change of viash from `com.dataintuitive.viash` to `io.viash`.\n\
  \n* `Functionality`: Reworked the `enabled` field from boolean to a `status` field\
  \ which can have the following statusses: `enabled`, `disabled` and `deprecated`.\n\
  \  When parsing a config file which has the `status` field set to `deprecated` a\
  \ warning message is displayed on stderr.\n  Backwards for `enabled` is provided\
  \ where `enabled: true` => `status: enabled` and `enabled: false` => `status: false`.\
  \ The `enabled` field is marked deprecated.\n\n### MINOR CHANGES\n\n* `Resources`:\
  \ Handle edge case when no resources are specified in the `vsh.yaml` config file\
  \ and display a warning message.\n\n* `BashWrapper`: Add a warning when an argument\
  \ containing flags (e.g. `--foo`) is not recognized and will be handled as a positional\
  \ argument as this is likely a mistake.\n\n* `Functionality`: Add check to verify\
  \ there are no double argument names or short names in the config `vsh.yaml` declarations.\n\
  \n* `BashWrapper`: Add check to verify a parameter isn't declared twice on the CLI,\
  \ except in the case `multiple: true` is declared as then it's a valid use case.\n\
  \n* `BashWrapper`: For int min/max checking: use native bash functionality so there\
  \ is no dependency to `bc`.\n  For double min/max checking: add fallback code to\
  \ use `awk` in case `bc` is not present on the system (most likely to happen when\
  \ running tests in a docker container).\n\n* `viash ns list/viash config view`:\
  \ Allow viewing the post-processed argument groups by passing the `--parse_argument_groups`\
  \ parameter.\n\n### TESTING\n\n* `ConfigMod`: Added unit tests for condition config\
  \ mods.\n\n* `MainTestDockerSuite`: Derive config alternatives from the base `vsh.yaml`\
  \ instead of adding the changes in separate files.\n  This both reduces file clutter\
  \ and prevents having to change several files when there are updates in the config\
  \ format.\n\n* `GitTest`: Added unit tests for Git helper (PR #216).\n\n### BUG\
  \ FIXES\n\n* `csharp_script`, `javascript_script`, `python_script`, `r_script`,\
  \ `scala_script`: Make meta fields for `memory` and `cpus` optional.\n\n* `NextflowVdsl3Platform`:\
  \ Don't generate an error when `--publish_dir` is not defined and `-profile no_publish`\
  \ is used.\n\n* `Viash run`: Viash now properly returns the exit code from the executed\
  \ script.\n\n* `Git`: Fix incorrect metadata when git repository is empty (PR #216).\n\

subtitle: Nextflow VDSL3 is now the default, support for tracking memory and cpu requirements
  more elegantly
version: 0.6.0
whats_new: '

  The first (major) release this year! The biggest changes are:


  * Nextflow VDSL3 is now the default Nextflow platform, whereas the legacy Nextflow
  platform has been deprecated.


  * Support for tracking memory and cpu requirements more elegantly.


  * Grouping arguments in groups more concisely.


  * The addition of a `viash ns exec` command, to be able to execute commands on Viash
  components more easily.
