changes: "### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n* `viash config`: An argument's example now needs\
  \ to be of the same type as the argument itself. \n  For example, `[ type: integer,\
  \ name: foo, example: 10 ]` is valid, whereas \n  `[ type: integer, name: foo, example:\
  \ bar ]` is not, as 'bar' cannot be cast to an integer.\n\n### NEW FUNCTIONALITY\n\
  \n* `viash config inject`: A command for inserting a Viash header into your script.\n\
  \n* `YumRequirement`: Added a requirement setup for installing through yum. Example:\n\
  \  `setup: [ [ type: yum, packages: [ wget] ] ]`\n\n* `DockerRequirement`: Allow\
  \ using copy and add instructions. Example:\n  `setup: [ [ type: docker, add: [\
  \ \"http://foo.bar .\" ]]]`\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\n* `ViashTest`: Fix verbosity passthrough.\n\
  \n* `--help`: Fix repeated usage flag when printing the help.\n\n"

subtitle: Argument examples need to be of the same type as the argument itself
version: 0.5.7
whats_new: "\nExamples for arguments now need to be of the same type as the argument\
  \ itself. You can't provide an `integer` for a `string`-based argument for example.\
  \  \nA handy new command has been added: `viash config inject`. This can be used\
  \ to inject a Viash header into a script based on the arguments of the config file.\n\
  \nThere have been some improvements to the Docker platform as well.  \nYou can now\
  \ add yum packages as a requirement:\n\n  ```yaml\n  platforms:\n    - type: docker\n\
  \      image: bash:latest\n      setup:\n        - type: yum\n          packages:\
  \ [ wget ]\n  ```\n\nYou can now include ADD and COPY instructions in the config\
  \ file:\n\n  ```yaml\n  platforms:\n    - type: docker\n      image: bash:latest\n\
  \      setup:\n        - type: docker\n          add: [ \"http://foo.bar .\" ]\n\
  \  ```\n\n"
