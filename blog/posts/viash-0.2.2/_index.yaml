subtitle: Generation of placeholder code now possible without VIASH START and VIASH
  END
version: 0.2.2
whats_new: "\nAllow generating placeholder without VIASH START/VIASH END blocks.\n\
  \nA script does not need to contain a `VIASH START`/`VIASH END` block in order to\
  \ function.\n\nPreviously, each script had to contain a codeblock as follows:\n\n\
  \  ```r\n  ## VIASH START\n  par <- list(\n    input = \"foo\",\n    output = \"\
  bar\n  )\n  ## VIASH END\n  ```\n\n"
