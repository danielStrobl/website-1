changes: "### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n* File format `functionality.yaml` is no longer\
  \ supported. Use `config.vsh.yaml` or `script.vsh.R/py/...` instead.\n\n* `viash\
  \ run` and `viash test`: By default, temporary files are removed when the execution\
  \ succeeded, otherwise they are kept. \n  This behaviour can be overridden by specifying\
  \ `--keep true` to always keep the temporary files, and `--keep false` to always\
  \ remove them.\n\n* `NXF`: `function_type: todir` now returns the output directory\
  \ on the `Channel` rather than its contents.\n\n### NEW FEATURES\n\n* Added `viash\
  \ ns test`: Run all tests in a particular namespace. For each test, the exit code\
  \ and duration is reported. Results can be written to a tsv file.\n* Added support\
  \ for JavaScript scripts.\n* Added support for Scala scripts.\n* `NXF`: publishing\
  \ has a few more options:\n  - `publish`: Publish or yes (default is false)\n  -\
  \ `per_id`: Publish results in directories containing the unique (sample) ID (default\
  \ is true)\n  - `path`: A prefix path for the results to be published (default is\
  \ empty)\n* Functionality resources and tests: Allow copying whole directories instead\
  \ of only single files. Also allow to rename the destination folder by specifying\
  \ a value for 'dest'.\n* Platform R / Python dependencies: Allow running a simple\
  \ command.\n\n### MAJOR CHANGES\n\n* The `-P <platform>` parameter will be deprecated.\
  \ For now, all `-P` values are simply passed to `-p`.\n* `viash ns build` and `viash\
  \ ns test`: Now use all available platforms if `-p` is not specified.\n* By default,\
  \ python packages will not be installed as user. Use `user: true` to modify this\
  \ behaviour.\n\n### MINOR CHANGES\n\n* Name of autogenerated Docker image is now\
  \ `ns/tool`.\n* Internal changes to make it easier to extend viash with more scripting\
  \ languages.\n* `NXF`: Default image is now `ns/tool` for consistency.\n* `NXF`:\
  \ Repurpose `asis` function type for having simple publishing steps (see docs).\n\
  * `NXF`: Add component name to main `process` name\n* R dependencies: by default,\
  \ do not reinstall Bioconductor packages. Set `bioc_force_install: true` to revert\
  \ this behaviour.\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\n* `viash build`: Do not display error messages\
  \ when pwd is not a git repository.\n\n### TESTING\n\n* `viash test`: Add tests\
  \ for `viash test` functionality.\n\n"
