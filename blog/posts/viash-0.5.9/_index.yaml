subtitle: Allow interrupting Viash components
version: 0.5.9
whats_new: '

  The biggest change in this release is that long running Viash components (VS Code
  server or R Studio server for example) can now be interrupted by pressing CTRL-C
  or by sending it an `INT` or `SIGINT` signal. Before this release, you had to manually
  stop the Docker container to get the component to terminate.
