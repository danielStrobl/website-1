changes: "### NEW FUNCTIONALITY\n\n* Add default labels in Nextflow config files that\
  \ set default values for cpu and memory settings (PR #412). Values are more or less\
  \ logarithmically spaced (1, 2, 5, 10, ...).\n\n* `Author`: Added `info` field to\
  \ authors. Deprecated `props` field (PR #423).\n\n* `viash config view` and `viash\
  \ ns list`: Set the `.info.output` path when a platform argument is provided.\n\n\
  * `viash ns exec`: Added two more fields:\n\n  - `{output}`: path to the destination\
  \ directory when building the component\n  - `{abs-output}`: absolute path to the\
  \ destination directory when building the component\n\n* `DockerPlatform`: Add `entrypoint`\
  \ and `cmd` parameters to the docker platform config that allows overriding the\
  \ default docker container settings (PR #432).\n\n### MINOR CHANGES\n\n* `Nextflow\
  \ VDSL3`:\n  - Add profiles to the Nextflow Config file when the main script is\
  \ a `NextflowScript` (#408).\n  - Add a `script` parameter in Nextflow Config file\
  \ to add a single string or list of strings to the `nextflow.config` (PR #430).\n\
  \n* `Scripts`: Remove the `entrypoint` parameter for all script types except `NextflowScript`\
  \ (#409). All these scripts had to check individually whether the parameter was\
  \ unset, now it can be done in the `Script` apply method.\n\n* `schema export`:\n\
  \  - Restructure Nextflow-Directives, -Auto and -Config into a `nextflowParameters`\
  \ group (PR #412). Previously only NextflowDirectives was exposed.\n  - Restructure\
  \ the format to group authors & computational requirements together with functionality\
  \ (PR #426).\n  - Restructure the Viash Config and Project Config pages under a\
  \ `config` category (PR #426).\n  - Add references in Functionality and Nextflow\
  \ VDSL3 to the new documentation pages (PR #426).\n  - Add description and/or examples\
  \ for platforms and requirements (PR #428).\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\n* `viash config\
  \ inject`: Fix an empty line being added at the script start for each time `viash\
  \ config inject` was run (#377).\n\n* `WorkflowHelper`: Fixed an issue where passing\
  \ a remote file URI (for example `http://` or `s3://`) as `param_list` caused `No\
  \ such file` errors.\n\n* `BashWrapper`: Fix escaping of the included script where\
  \ a line starting with a pipe character with optional leading spaces is stripped\
  \ of the leading spaces and pipe character.\n  This was quite unlikely to happen\
  \ except when `viash config inject` was called on a Nextflow Script, which lead\
  \ to no real config code being injected however workflows were getting corrupted.\
  \ (#421)\n\n* `Deprecation testbench`: Add missing classes to be checked (PR #426).\n\
  \n"

subtitle: Minor bug fixes and minor improvements to VDSL3
version: 0.7.4
whats_new: '

  Some small fixes and consistency improvements.

  A few Quality of Life improvements were made e.g. to override the Docker `entrypoint`
  when working with Nextflow and providing default labels when building a Nextflow
  workflow.
