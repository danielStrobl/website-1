changes: "### MAJOR CHANGES\n\n* `Config`: Made major internal changes w.r.t. how\
  \ config files are read and at which point a platform (native, docker, nextflow)\n\
  \  is applied to the functionality script. The only visible side effect is that\
  \ \n  `viash ns list` will output each config only once instead of multiple times.\n\
  \n* `Functionality`: Structured annotation can be added to a functionality and its\
  \ arguments using the `info` field. Example:\n  ```yaml\n  functionality:\n    name:\
  \ foo\n    info:\n      site: https://abc.xyz\n      tags: [ one, two, three ]\n\
  \    arguments:\n      - name: --foo\n        type: string\n        info:\n    \
  \      foo: bar\n          a:\n            b:\n              c\n  ```\n\n### MINOR\
  \ CHANGES\n\n* `BashWrapper`: Allow printing the executor command by adding `---verbose\
  \ ---verbose` to a `viash run` or an executable.\n\n* `Testbenches`: Rework `MainBuildAuxiliaryNativeParameterCheck`\
  \ to create stimulus files and loop over the file from bash instead of looping natively.\n\
  \  This prevents creating thousands of new processes which would only test a single\
  \ parameter.\n  Note this still calls the main script for each stimulus separately,\
  \ but that was the case anyway, only much much worse.\n\n* `Testbenches`: Split\
  \ some grouped test benches into slightly smaller test benches that group tested\
  \ functionality better.\n\n* `Annotations`: Complete the config schema annotations.\n\
  \  Make sure all arguments are documented.\n  Added an annotation `internalFunctionality`\
  \ and `undocumented` for arguments that should not be documented.\n  Added a testbench\
  \ that verifies that all arguments are in fact annotated, skipping those that are\
  \ not in the class constructor.\n  Adds a hierarchy field in the `__this__` member\
  \ to list the relation of the own and parent classes.\n\n* `Testbenches`: Add exit\
  \ code to helper method `testMainWithStdErr`.\n\n* `Testbenches`: Add testbench\
  \ to verify viash underscore components (viash_build, viash_install, viash_push,\
  \ viash_skeleton, viash_test).\n\n* `Testbenches`: Update viash underscore component\
  \ tests to use `$meta_executable`.\n\n* `viash ns exec`: Allow choosing whether\
  \ the `{platform}` field should be filled in, based on the `--apply_platform` parameter.\n\
  \n### BUG FIXES\n\n* `DockerPlatform`: Remove duplicate auto-mounts (#257).\n\n\
  * `Underscore component tests`: Fix tests for `viash_skeleton` and `viash_test`\
  \ components.\n\n* `NextflowVDSL3Platform`: Fix 'Module scriptPath has not been\
  \ defined yet' error when Nextflow>=22.10 (#269).\n\n* `config inject`: Doesn't\
  \ work when `must_exist == true` (#273).\n\n* `RScript`: Fix compatibility issue\
  \ where the new character escaping in `r_script` required R>=4.0 (#275). Escaping\
  \ is now handled without\n  using the new `r'(foo)'` notation.\n\n### DEPRECATION\n\
  \n* `DockerRequirements`: The `resources:` setting has been deprecated and will\
  \ be removed in Viash 0.7.0. Please use `copy:` instead.\n\n* `DockerRequirements`:\
  \ The `privileged:` setting has been deprecated and will be removed in Viash 0.7.0.\
  \ Please use `run_args: \"--privileged\"` instead.\n\n### EXPERIMENTAL FUNCTIONALITY\n\
  \n* `Config`: Any part of a Viash config can use inheritance to fill data (#271).\
  \ For example:\n  Contents of `src/test/config.vsh.yaml`:\n  ```yaml\n  __inherits__:\
  \ ../api/base.yaml\n  functionality:\n    name: test\n    resources:\n      - type:\
  \ bash_script\n        path: script.sh\n        text: |\n          echo Copying\
  \ $par_input to $par_output\n          cp $par_input $par_output\n  ```\n  Contents\
  \ of `src/api/base.yaml`:\n  ```yaml\n  functionality:\n    arguments:\n      -\
  \ name: \"--input\"\n        type: file\n      - name: \"--output\"\n        type:\
  \ file\n        direction: output\n  ```\n  The resulting yaml will be:\n  ```yaml\n\
  \  functionality:\n    name: test\n    arguments:\n      - name: \"--input\"\n \
  \       type: file\n      - name: \"--output\"\n        type: file\n        direction:\
  \ output\n    resources:\n      - type: bash_script\n        path: script.sh\n \
  \       text: |\n          echo Copying $par_input to $par_output\n          cp\
  \ $par_input $par_output\n  ```\n\n"

subtitle: Quality-of-life improvements in Viash.
version: 0.6.3
whats_new: '

  This release features contains mostly quality of life improvements and some experimental
  functionality. Most notably:


  * `viash ns list` now only returns a config just once instead of once per platform.


  * A functionality''s info field can contain any data structures. An `.info` field
  was added to arguments as well.


  * Bug fixes for using Viash with podman, Nextflow>=22.10 and R<4.0.


  * Experimental support for inheriting from config partials.
