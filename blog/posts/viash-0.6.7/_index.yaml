changes: "### MINOR CHANGES\n\n* `NextflowPlatform`: Create directories during a stub\
  \ run when output path is a nested directory (PR #314).\n\n* Automatically generate\
  \ a warning for deprecated parameters while parsing a .viash.yaml configuration\
  \ file using the inline documentation deprecation annotations.\n\n* Add a \"planned\
  \ removal\" field in the deprecation annotations.\n\n* Add testbenches to verify\
  \ proper formatting of the deprecation versions and compare current version to the\
  \ planned removal version so no deprecated parameters get to stick around beyond\
  \ what was planned.\n\n* `NextflowPlatform`: Nextflow processes are created lazily;\
  \ that is, only when running\n  a Nextflow workflow (PR #321).\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\
  \n* `NextflowPlatform`: Automatically split Viash config strings into strings of\
  \ \n  length 65000 since the JVM has a limit (65536) on the length of string constants\
  \ (PR #323).\n\n"
