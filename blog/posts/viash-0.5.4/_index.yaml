subtitle: Added cache directive to specify the typing of caching to be performed for
  the Nextflow platform
version: 0.5.4
whats_new: "\nA cache type can now be specified in the config file for the Nextflow\
  \ platform. Previously this was hardcoded to be `deep`, but the default caching\
  \ method is now `default`.  \nTo use deep caching again, add this to your config\
  \ file:\n\n  ```yaml\n  cache: deep\n  ```\n\n"
