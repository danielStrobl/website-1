changes: "### MINOR CHANGES\n\n* `DataflowHelper`: Add assertions and `def`s.\n\n\
  ### BUG FIXES\n\n* `VDSL3`: Only the first two elements from an event in a channel\
  \ are now passed to a process. This avoids calculating cache entries based on arguments\
  \ that are not used by the process, causing false-negative cache misses.\n\n* `config_schema`:\n\
  \  - Correct some incorrect markdown tags.\n  - Add project config.\n  - Correct\
  \ documentation/markdown tags to the correct order.\n  - Add summary description\
  \ and example for 'resource' and 'argument', to be used on the reference website.\n\
  \  - Add documentation for the Nextflow directives.\n\n* `cli_schema`: Correct documentation/markdown\
  \ tags to the correct order.\n\n"
