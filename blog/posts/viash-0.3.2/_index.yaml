changes: "### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n* `viash build`: Do not automatically generate a\
  \ viash.yaml when creating an executable. \n  Instead, you need to add the `-w|--write_meta`\
  \ flag in order to let viash know that it\n  should generate a viash.yaml in the\
  \ resources dir.\n\n### MAJOR CHANGES\n\n* `NXF`: Add beta functionality for running\
  \ viash tests in Nextflow.\n\n### MINOR CHANGES\n\n* Resources: Rework the way resources\
  \ paths are converted to absolute URIs, should not have any impact on UX.\n\n###\
  \ BUG FIXES\n\n* `NXF`: Add temporary workaround for determining the used image\
  \ name when running a component.\n\n* Docker Platform: Set default setup strategy\
  \ to \"alwayscachedbuild\" as this used to be the default viash behaviour.\n\n*\
  \ `NXF`: Fix issue where resource dir would not get mounted depending on which inputs\
  \ are provided.\n\n* `NXF`: Accept multiple inputs when component is running as\
  \ standalone.\n\n"
